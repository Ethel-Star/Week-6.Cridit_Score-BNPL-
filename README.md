Credit Scoring Model for BNPL: Balancing Access and Risk

Project Overview

You are an Analytics Engineer at Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider with over 10 years of experience. Bati Bank is collaborating with a rising eCommerce platform to launch a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service, allowing customers to purchase products on credit if they qualify. This project aims to develop a robust Credit Scoring Model to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and enable responsible lending.

What is Credit Scoring?

Credit scoring assigns a quantitative measure to a potential borrower, estimating the likelihood of default in the future. Traditionally, creditors build credit scoring models using statistical techniques to analyze historical data from previous borrowers in relation to their loan performance. These models are then used to assess new applicants by comparing their information against past trends. The output can either be:

A credit score representing the applicant's creditworthiness.

A prediction of whether the applicant will default.

Key Context

The definition of "default" varies across financial institutions but must comply with the Basel II Capital Accord. This regulatory standard outlines factors banks must consider when issuing new loans. A summary of Basel II is available here.

Objectives

Your primary task is to build a product that fulfills the following:

Define a Proxy Variable

Identify and define a variable to categorize users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good).

Select Predictive Features

Choose observable features that correlate strongly with the default variable defined in step 1.

Develop Risk Probability Model

Build a model that assigns a probability of default to each new customer.

Credit Score Model

Develop a model to calculate credit scores based on risk probability estimates.

Loan Recommendation Model

Create a model to predict the optimal loan amount and duration for approved customers.

Deliverables

A fully functional Credit Scoring Model.

Documentation of the methodology, assumptions, and results.

Compliance with Basel II standards for credit risk assessment.

Insights into borrower risk profiles, predictive features, and optimal loan recommendations
